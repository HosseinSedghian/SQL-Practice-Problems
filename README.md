# README.md for SQL Practice Problems Repository

## Overview

Welcome to my repository dedicated to solving the exercises from **"SQL Practice Problems"** by Sylvia Moestl Vasilik. This project includes the complete database schema and data files necessary to practice and solve the SQL problems presented in the book.

## Contents

- **Database Schema**: SQL files defining the structure of the database.
- **Sample Data**: SQL files containing sample data for testing and practice.
- **Solutions**: SQL scripts that contain solutions to the problems outlined in the book.

## Getting Started
